## marking criteria

grade     |  marks | description                                                                                  |
----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
excellent | 85-100 | work with impressive elements significantly exceeding what would be regarded as satisfactory |
good 	  | 60-75% | acceptable work demonstrating solid and satisfactory level of achievement for the criteria   |
partial   | 30-45% | borderline work. demonstrates some relevant skills and work but below the level expected     |
absent 	  |    0   | no serious attempt made

---

## something awesome
* worth 30% of your grade
* there's a document outlining a bunch of ideas, you can select from it, or propose something new if you'd like.
* make a blog post describing your idea, and send it to me by Sunday

---

## something awesome options
* learning: e.g. coding or lockpicking
* teaching: pick something from the first 4/5 weeks of term, spend week 6 teaching that to someone (or a group of people)
* auditing: pick something real (e.g. lecture halls at UNSW, not your house), and write up a document explaining any vulnerabilities in it's security.

---

## hall of fame
* present something for about 3-5 minutes during a tutorial.
* it can't just be something from the lectures.
* bonus marks!?
    * one, maybe two if you hack NASA or something.

---

## simplified grading
huh

* apparently you can opt for a pass/fail system of grading
* but a pass is a 70, and fail is ?? idk
* you can change this anytime up until monday week 7
