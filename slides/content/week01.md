## Something Awesome
* Worth 30% of your grade
* There's a document outlining a bunch of ideas, you can select from it, or propose something new if you'd like.
* Make a blog post describing your idea, and send it to my by Sunday
* I'll mark general ones, anything related to Law is marked by Lyria.

---

## Something Awesome options
* Learning: e.g. coding or lockpicking
* Teaching: pick something from the first 4/5 weeks of term, spend week 6 teaching that to someone (or a group of people)
* Auditing: pick something real (e.g. lecture halls at UNSW, not your house), and write up a document explaining any vulnerabilities in it's security.

---

## Hall of fame
* Present something for about 3-5 minutes during a tutorial.
* It can't just be something from the lectures.
* Bonus marks!?
    * One, maybe two if you hack NASA or something.

## COMP6441 vs COMP6841
* Extended isn't much more difficult, there's just "more" content.
* A few more weekly challenges, "extra" exam questions, and an extra lecture hour each week.
* If you're technically-inclined, I'd recommend 6841.
* Generally extended security courses are intended for people with an interest in pursuing security-adjacent careers

## Other security courses
* COMP6[84]43
* COMP6[84]45
* COMP6447
* COMP9447
* COMP6448
